# FinOps-FOCUS-Dashboards
These are dummy dashboard templates built with FinOps FOCUS 1.0 billing data.  These are used for multi-cloud clients who want to compare costs across multiple hyperscalers, and follow the FinOps FOCUS schema for consistency.  These are basic templates, as I have many more examples of deeper customization around Team Chargeback/Showback, Metric Tracking, KPI's, Optimization Opportunities, Savings Realized, etc..
